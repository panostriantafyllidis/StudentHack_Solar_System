        Ganymede is the largest moon of Jupiter and the largest in the solar system. It is the only moon known to have its own magnetic field.
        Despite its cold, icy surface, there is evidence suggesting that Ganymede has subsurface oceans that could contain more water than all of Earth's surface water combined.

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbital Period: 7.15 days</li>
        <li>Diameter: Approximately 5,268 km</li>
        <li>Climate: Predominantly icy with a thin oxygen atmosphere</li>
        <li>Average Distance from Jupiter: About 1,070,000 km</li>
        <li>Orbital Speed: Approximately 10.88 km/s</li>

    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        Ganymede's atmosphere is primarily composed of oxygen, albeit extremely thin and not breathable.
        The presence of an intrinsic magnetic field and aurorae suggest a complex electromagnetic environment.
