    <p>
        Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in our solar system.
        Known for its extreme temperature fluctuations and cratered surface, Mercury does not have an atmosphere capable of supporting life as we know it.

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbital Period: 88 Earth days</li>
        <li>Diameter: Approximately 4,880 km</li>
        <li>Climate: Extreme temperatures ranging from -173 °C during the night to 427 °C during the day</li>
        <li>Average Distance from the Sun: About 57.91 million km</li>
        <li>Orbital Speed: Approximately 47.87 km/s</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        Mercury's exosphere is composed mainly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. It is too thin to support a stable atmosphere and protect the planet from cosmic rays and solar wind.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mercury has no moons or rings.</li>
        <li>Due to its slow rotation and fast orbital speed, a day on Mercury (from sunrise to sunrise) lasts about 176 Earth days.</li>
        <li>Mercury's surface experiences the greatest temperature variation of the planets in our solar system due to its lack of atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>
