        Rhea is the second largest moon of Saturn and the ninth largest moon in the solar system.
        With a heavily cratered surface and a very thin atmosphere, Rhea presents a stark contrast to the Earth-like conditions we know.

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbital Period: 4.518 days</li>
        <li>Diameter: Approximately 1,527 km</li>
        <li>Climate: Lacks a substantial atmosphere, leading to extreme temperature variations</li>
        <li>Average Distance from Saturn: About 527,000 km</li>
        <li>Orbital Speed: Approximately 8.48 km/s</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        Rhea's atmosphere is extremely tenuous, primarily composed of oxygen and carbon dioxide, but far too thin to support life as we know it.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rhea may have a faint ring system, making it the only moon known to potentially possess rings.</li>
        <li>Despite its solid ice surface, Rhea's weak atmosphere suggests it has no significant geological activity.</li>
        <li>Rhea's surface features include craters and bright wispy streaks, believed to be ice cliffs created by tectonic fractures.</li>
    </ul>
