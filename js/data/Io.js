        Io is one of Jupiter's moons and the fourth largest moon in the solar system. Known for its extreme geological activity, Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system, with hundreds of volcanoes, some erupting lava fountains up to 500 kilometers high.

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbital Period: 1.77 Earth days</li>
        <li>Diameter: Approximately 3,643 km</li>
        <li>Surface: Dominated by sulfur and sulfur dioxide frost</li>
        <li>Average Distance from Jupiter: About 421,700 km</li>
        <li>Orbital Speed: Approximately 17.334 km/s</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        Io's thin atmosphere is primarily composed of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), with minor components of other gases such as sulfur monoxide and sodium chloride.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Io's orbit is slightly eccentric, which, along with gravitational interactions with Jupiter, causes intense tidal heating.</li>
        <li>The intense geological activity reshapes Io's surface rapidly, erasing impact craters and continually forming new mountains and lava flows.</li>
        <li>Despite its hostile environment, Io plays a crucial role in shaping Jupiter's magnetosphere through its volcanic plumes and atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>
