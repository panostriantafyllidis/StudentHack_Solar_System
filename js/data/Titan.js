    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbital Period: 15.94 Earth days</li>
        <li>Diameter: Approximately 5,150 km</li>
        <li>Climate: Has a thick atmosphere; primarily nitrogen with methane and ethane clouds and rain</li>
        <li>Average Distance from Saturn: About 1.2 million km</li>
        <li>Surface Temperature: Approximately -179 degrees Celsius</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        Titan's atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen (95%) with small amounts of methane and other hydrocarbons. This thick atmosphere is more substantial than that of any other moon in the Solar System and is the only nitrogen-rich dense atmosphere on a moon.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Titan has rivers, lakes, and seas of liquid methane and ethane, making its surface one of the most Earth-like places in the Solar System in terms of geology.</li>
        <li>Despite its low temperatures, Titan's atmosphere allows for the formation of complex organic molecules, leading some scientists to speculate about possible microbial life.</li>
        <li>The thick haze of Titan's atmosphere obscures its surface features from visible light observations, but radar and infrared measurements have penetrated the haze, revealing an intricate and active geology.</li>
    </ul>
