        Deimos is one of the two moons of Mars and is the smaller and outermost of the two. It orbits Mars at a much greater distance than its larger sibling, Phobos.
        Deimos is irregularly shaped and has a surface that is heavily cratered, reflecting its history of impacts.

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbital Period: About 30.3 hours</li>
        <li>Diameter: Approximately 12.4 km on its longest axis</li>
        <li>Surface Features: Characterized by a smooth, dusty surface with craters and ridges</li>
        <li>Average Distance from Mars: About 23,460 km</li>
        <li>Orbital Speed: Approximately 1.35 km/s</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        Deimos does not have a significant atmosphere; its gravitational pull is too weak to retain any substantial atmosphere, resulting in a near-vacuum environment.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Deimos is named after the Greek god of terror, a fitting name for a moon that silently orbits the Red Planet.</li>
        <li>Due to its small size and distant orbit, Deimos takes longer to orbit Mars than Phobos, which is the fastest orbiting natural satellite in the solar system.</li>
        <li>Its surface is less grooved and smoother compared to Phobos, suggesting a different bombardment history or surface composition.</li>
    </ul>
