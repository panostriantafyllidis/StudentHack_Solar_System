        Triton is the largest moon of Neptune and is one of the few geologically active moons in the solar system.
        It features a surface covered mostly by frozen nitrogen with water ice, carbon dioxide ice, and a rocky core.

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbital Period: 5.877 days</li>
        <li>Diameter: Approximately 2,706 km</li>
        <li>Climate: Extremely cold, with surface temperatures around -235 degrees Celsius</li>
        <li>Average Distance from Neptune: About 354,800 km</li>
        <li>Orbital Speed: Approximately 4.39 km/s</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        Triton has a tenuous atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen with small amounts of methane near the surface.
        This thin atmosphere can support transient clouds and even a type of 'snow' made from nitrogen.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Triton orbits Neptune in a retrograde direction, which is opposite to most other moons in the solar system.</li>
        <li>It is believed that Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity and is not an original satellite of the planet.</li>
        <li>Triton's geysers can eject particles up to 8 km above its surface, suggesting internal geologic activity.</li>
    </ul>
