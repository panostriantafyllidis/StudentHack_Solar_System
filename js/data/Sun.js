        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System and is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
        Its immense gravity holds the solar system together, and its light and heat have been the main drivers of the planet's climate and weather.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Sun's magnetic field is very strong and variable, a phenomenon that is visible as sunspots on the surface and drives solar activity like solar flares.</li>
        <li>Every eleven years, the Sun's magnetic field undergoes a reversal, which affects the intensity and number of sunspots.</li>
        <li>The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has enough nuclear fuel to stay as it is for another 5 billion years.</li>
    </ul>
