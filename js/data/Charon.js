        Charon is the largest moon of the dwarf planet Pluto and was discovered in 1978 by James Christy. It is a significant body in the Kuiper belt and is notable for being almost half the size of Pluto itself, making the Pluto-Charon system more of a binary dwarf planet system.

        <li>Diameter: Approximately 1,212 km</li>
        <li>Surface: Icy with varied terrain, including canyons and plains</li>
        <li>Average Distance from Pluto: About 17,536 km</li>
        <li>Gravity: 0.288 m/s² (about 1/12th of Earth's)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Surface and Geology</h2>
    <p>
        Charon's surface is mostly composed of water ice with some ammonia hydrates. It has a young surface geologically, with fewer craters than expected, suggesting recent geological activity.
