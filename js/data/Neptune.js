        <li>Diameter: Approximately 49,244 km</li>
        <li>Climate: Extremely cold with strong wind speeds</li>
        <li>Average Distance from the Sun: About 4.5 billion km (30.1 AU)</li>
        <li>Orbital Speed: Approximately 5.43 km/s</li>

    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        Neptune's atmosphere is marked by extremely dynamic weather patterns and the fastest planetary winds in the solar system, with speeds reaching up to 2,100 km/h. The atmosphere consists mostly of hydrogen, helium, water, and methane, the latter of which gives the planet its striking blue hue.
