        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to their similar size, mass, and proximity to the Sun.
        Known for its harsh conditions, Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it inhospitable for life as we know it.

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbital Period: 224.7 days</li>
        <li>Diameter: Approximately 12,104 km</li>
        <li>Climate: Extremely hot with a surface temperature of about 462°C (864°F)</li>
        <li>Average Distance from the Sun: About 108 million km (0.72 AU)</li>
        <li>Orbital Speed: Approximately 35.02 km/s</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        Venus has an incredibly dense atmosphere, with a pressure 92 times that of Earth's. This atmosphere consists mostly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, contributing to the extreme greenhouse effect and high surface temperatures.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets in our solar system, which means on Venus the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.</li>
        <li>Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, despite being second from the Sun, due to its dense atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Venus does not have any moons, a rare characteristic among the solar system's planets.</li>
    </ul>
