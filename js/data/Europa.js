    <p>
        Europa is one of the four largest moons of Jupiter and is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon.
        It is notable for its smooth, icy surface and the strong evidence suggesting a subsurface ocean beneath its ice crust.

    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
        Europa's atmosphere is extremely thin, primarily composed of oxygen, though it is far too thin to support human life.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Europa's icy surface is crisscrossed by a series of cracks and striations, which are thought to be caused by the tidal flexing exerted by Jupiter.</li>
        <li>The presence of a subsurface ocean under its icy crust makes it a likely candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.</li>
        <li>Despite its cold environment, the interaction between Europa's ocean and rocky mantle could create the potential for life-supporting environments.</li>
