        Phobos is one of the two moons orbiting Mars, being the larger and closer of the two. Despite its proximity, Phobos is destined to meet a dramatic end, as it is gradually spiraling inward towards Mars.

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbital Period: About 7.66 hours</li>
        <li>Diameter: Approximately 22.4 km</li>
        <li>Surface: Features numerous craters and grooves</li>
        <li>Average Distance from Mars: About 9,376 km</li>
        <li>Orbital Speed: Approximately 2.14 km/s</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Surface Features</h2>
    <p>
        Phobos is marked by a stark, barren landscape dominated by the massive Stickney crater, along with a network of grooves and ridges that suggest geological activity or tidal forces at work.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Phobos is one of the darkest bodies in the solar system, reflecting only about 7% of the sunlight that hits it.</li>
        <li>Its orbit is so close to Mars that it orbits the planet faster than Mars rotates; from the Martian surface, Phobos can be seen rising in the west and setting in the east.</li>
        <li>Due to tidal forces, it is estimated that Phobos will be pulled apart or crash into Mars in about 30 to 50 million years.</li>
    </ul>
