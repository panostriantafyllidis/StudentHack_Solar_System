        Callisto is the second-largest moon of Jupiter and the third-largest moon in the Solar System.
        Known for its heavily cratered surface, it is the most heavily cratered object in the Solar System.
        This suggests a long history of impacts.

    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbital Period: About 16.69 days</li>
        <li>Diameter: Approximately 4,820 km</li>
        <li>Surface: Characterized by a mix of ice and rock</li>
        <li>Average Distance from Jupiter: About 1,882,700 km</li>
        <li>Orbital Speed: Approximately 8.204 km/s</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Surface and Composition</h2>
    <p>
        Callisto's surface is a mix of ice and rock, with a possible subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust. Its lack of an atmosphere and geological activity implies a very stable surface.

    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Callisto is thought to have the lowest density of all the Galilean moons, indicating a high composition of water ice.</li>
        <li>Unlike other Galilean moons, Callisto does not experience significant tidal heating, which accounts for its lack of geological activity.</li>
        <li>Callisto is considered a prime candidate for future space missions due to its relatively low radiation levels compared to other Jovian moons.</li>
    </ul>
