    <h2>Key Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Orbital Period: 8.7 days</li>
        <li>Diameter: Approximately 1,578 km</li>
        <li>Climate: Extremely cold with a surface temperature around -184 degrees Celsius</li>
        <li>Average Distance from Uranus: About 436,000 km</li>
        <li>Orbital Speed: Approximately 3.64 km/s</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Surface and Composition</h2>
    <p>
        Titania's surface is composed of water ice mixed with a dark material, creating a slightly reddish hue. The moon's surface is marked by large faults and canyons, some of which are up to 1500 kilometers long and several kilometers deep.
